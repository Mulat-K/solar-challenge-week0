# 🌞 Solar Data Discovery – Exploratory Data Analysis (Task 2)

## 📘 Project Overview
This repository contains my work for **Task 2: Data Profiling, Cleaning & EDA** in the **Solar Data Discovery Challenge** organized by **10 Academy**.  
The challenge focuses on analyzing environmental and solar radiation data from **Benin**, **Sierra Leone**, and **Togo** to help **MoonLight Energy Solutions** identify the most promising regions for solar energy installations.

This task focuses on:
- Profiling, cleaning, and exploring the solar datasets for each country.  
- Preparing the data for cross-country comparison and interactive visualization.

## 🧭 Business Objective
**MoonLight Energy Solutions** aims to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability through data-driven solar investments.  
This analysis provides insights into **solar potential** and **environmental factors** that influence solar performance, using variables such as:

- **GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance)**  
- **DNI (Direct Normal Irradiance)**  
- **DHI (Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance)**  
- **Temperature (Tamb, TModA, TModB)**  
- **Relative Humidity (RH)**  
- **Wind Speed (WS, WSgust)**  
- **Cleaning Events & Precipitation**

The goal is to identify **high-potential regions** that align with the company’s long-term sustainability goals.
